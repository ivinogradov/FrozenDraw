FrozenDraw is a basic drawing iOS application written in Objective-C with the use of StoryBoards.

FrozenDraw allows the user to select a color and draw on the screen with their finger. It also allows the end user to clear the drawing.

While the initial implementation utilized CoreGraphics, the new implementation uses CoreAnimation (through view layers) to render drawings.
